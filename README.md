## Overview

The intention for this Project is to create a free, offline-only Android application designed for
dart enthusiasts of all skill levels.

## Installation

1. **Installation:**
    * Currently, you can build and install the app from source, by cloning the project and importing
      it into Android studio.
    * When reaching `v1.0.0`, it is planned to be made available on the Google Play Store.

## Todo's

* **Practice**: Add a practice mode to bundle one or more game modes into a repeatable routine.
* **UI**: Rework/Enhance the user experience and layout. As there are a lot of different phone
  spec's out there, it is hard to guarantee expected behaviour for them all.
